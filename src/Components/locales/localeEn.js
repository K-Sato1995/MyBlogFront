    "People often find me outgoing, upbeat, self-motivated and silly. I grew up in a very small and peaceful town and moved to a huge city for college.",
  "about.paragraphTwo":
    "In college, I majored in political economy and mainly spent my time there studying international political economy and public economics. I also started coding when I was a senior and have been studying programming since then.",
  "about.paragraphThree":
    "Though what I learnt in college was academically very interesting, I didn't necessarily consider myself suitable for a politician or economist. I also was not interested in sales or marketing which a lot of my friends in the same department ended up doing after college. So I ended up getting a job as a webdeveloper since I really liked coding and I was really fascinated with the idea of createing something unique and original that didn't exist before.",
